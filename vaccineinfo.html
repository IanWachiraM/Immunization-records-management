        <h2>BCG Vaccine</h2>
        <p>The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis (TB). The BCG vaccine is used to prevent severe forms of tuberculosis, such as tuberculosis meningitis in children and disseminated TB in infants.
            The BCG vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine derived from a strain of the bacterium Mycobacterium bovis, which causes tuberculosis in cattle.
        </p>
        
       <p><strong>Mode of Administration:</strong>  The BCG vaccine is typically administered via intradermal injection at birth.
        In most cases, a single dose of the BCG vaccine is sufficient to provide protection against tuberculosis. 
        In some countries where TB is more prevalent, additional doses may be given to certain populations.
        The BCG vaccine is most effective in preventing severe forms of TB in children, such as TB meningitis. 
       </p>
       <p>
        Its effectiveness against pulmonary TB, the most common form of the disease, varies widely between populations and is generally lower in adults.
        
       </p>
       <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the BCG vaccine for all infants in countries with a high prevalence of TB, as well as for certain groups at increased risk of severe TB, such as HIV-infected infants and children.
        It's important to note that the BCG vaccine does not provide complete protection against tuberculosis, and efforts to control TB also involve strategies such as early diagnosis, treatment of active cases, and infection control measures. 
        Additionally, the availability and use of the BCG vaccine may vary between countries based on TB prevalence and national immunization policies.

        <h2>Polio Vaccine</h2>
        <p> The polio vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent poliomyelitis (polio), a highly contagious viral disease that can lead to paralysis, breathing problems, and even death
            There are two main types of polio vaccine:
            Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV): This vaccine contains killed poliovirus strains and is <strong>given by injection (shot)</strong>. It provides immunity against all three types of poliovirus.
            Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV): This vaccine contains weakened live poliovirus strains and is <strong>given orally (by mouth)</strong>. 
            It also provides immunity against all three types of poliovirus. OPV has been the main vaccine used globally in the eradication efforts due to its ease of administration and ability to provide community immunity (herd immunity).
        </p>
        <p>
            Polio vaccination is typically administered as part of routine childhood immunization schedules in many countries. 
            Additionally, mass vaccination campaigns are conducted periodically in high-risk areas to boost immunity and reach children who may have been missed by routine immunization programs.
            Both IPV and OPV are highly effective in preventing polio. 
            They stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the poliovirus, providing immunity. OPV is particularly effective at stopping person-to-person transmission of the virus due to its ability to induce immunity in the intestines, where the virus primarily replicates.

        <h2>DPT Vaccine.</h2>
        <p>
            The DPT vaccine is a combination vaccine that protects against three bacterial diseases: diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus.<br>
            Diphtheria: Diphtheria is a bacterial infection that can cause a thick covering in the back of the throat, leading to difficulty breathing, paralysis, and even death.<br>
            Pertussis (Whooping Cough): Pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the respiratory system characterized by severe coughing fits. It can be particularly dangerous for infants and young children.<br>
            Tetanus: Tetanus is caused by a bacterial toxin and leads to severe muscle stiffness, spasms, and lockjaw. It can be fatal if left untreated.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Whole-cell DPT Vaccine: This vaccine contains killed whole cells of the bacteria that cause diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. It was the original formulation of the vaccine but is associated with a higher risk of side effects, such as fever and local reactions at the injection site.<br>
            Acellular DPT Vaccine: This newer formulation contains only purified components of the bacteria that cause diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. It tends to have fewer side effects compared to the whole-cell vaccine while still providing effective protection against the diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The DPT vaccine is typically administered in a series of doses during infancy and childhood, usually starting around 2 months of age.
            The exact schedule may vary depending on the country's immunization program but often involves doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, with booster doses given later in childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Mode of Administration:</strong> The DPT vaccine can be administered through intramuscular injection. 
            The vaccine is usually administered into the muscle of the upper arm (deltoid muscle) or the thigh muscle (vastus lateralis). 
            The exact injection site may vary depending on the age of the recipient and the preferences of the healthcare provider.

        <h2>Hepatitis B Vaccine</h2>
        <p>
            The Hepatitis B vaccine is a vaccine that protects against the Hepatitis B virus, which can cause liver inflammation and lead to acute and chronic liver disease.
            The Hepatitis B vaccine contains a recombinant form of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), which stimulates the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the Hepatitis B virus.<br>
            The Hepatitis B vaccine is highly effective in preventing Hepatitis B infection and its complications.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all infants shortly after birth, as well as for adolescents and adults who were not vaccinated during infancy.<br>
            It is also recommended for individuals at increased risk of Hepatitis B infection, including healthcare workers, people with multiple sexual partners, people who inject drugs, and individuals with certain medical conditions such as chronic liver disease or HIV infection.<br>
            The Hepatitis B vaccine is <strong>administered intramuscularly</strong>, usually in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm for adults and older children, or in the anterolateral thigh muscle for infants and young children.
            The vaccine <strong>should not be administered intradermally (into the skin) or subcutaneously (under the skin)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Hepatitis B vaccine is typically administered as a series of injections.<br>
            The standard schedule for the vaccine includes three doses: the second dose is given one month after the first dose, and the third dose is given six months after the first dose.<br>
            In certain circumstances, an accelerated schedule may be used, particularly for individuals at high risk of Hepatitis B infection.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Common side effects of the Hepatitis B vaccine are mild and include soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site, as well as mild fever or fatigue.
            Serious side effects are rare but can include severe allergic reactions.

        <h2>Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Vaccine</h2>
        <p>
            RSV is a common cause of severe respiratory illness in infants and young children. Those infected with RSV can have difficulty breathing and eating, and sometimes may need respiratory support or hydration in the hospital. 
            An RSV immunization uses monoclonal antibodies  to protect infants and young children from severe RSV disease. 
            This immunization gives your baby’s body extra help to fight an RSV infection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Preganant mothers at 32-36 weeks of pregnancy, can get the RSV vaccine. It is also administered to babies at birth.
            Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. 
            However, it can be dangerous for babies, toddlers, and older adults.
